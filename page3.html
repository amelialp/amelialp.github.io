        <h3>Disney's<i> Pinocchio </i> (1940), was a critical success and commercial failure. Review from <i> Time </i>: "In craftsmanship and delicacy of drawing and coloring, in the articulation of its dozens of characters, in the greater variety and depth of its photographic effects, it tops the high standard Snow White set. The charm, humor and loving care with which it treats its inanimate characters puts it in a class by itself."</h3>

        <h3><span class="captiontitle">The Green Fisherman, or <i>Il Pescatore Verde</i> is a villain in Collodi's original <i>Adventures</i>. His appearance in the story is a nod to Homer's cyclops Polyphemus.</span></h3>

        </a>
        <h3>The Fairy with Turquoise Hair, or <i>La Fata dai capelli turchini</i> was written into the story as a guardian angel figure after Collodi's editors asked him to give it a nicer ending (the original serialized version saw Pinocchio get hanged for his bad behavior).</h3>

        <p class="intro body">The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. </p>

        <p class="body"> Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well.

First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
